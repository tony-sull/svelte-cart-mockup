# NumberSpinner

[ ] NumberSpinner isn't setup for proper ARIA accessibility

- [WC3 example](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/spinbutton/datepicker-spinbuttons.html)
- [Spinbutton example](https://www.digitala11y.com/spinbutton-role/)

The component should use a role="spinnbutton". It also may need to hide the plus/minus buttons and allow keyboard input for up/down. Need to investigate that further
